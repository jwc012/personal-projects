        <h1>SLIME CARE</h1>
        <p>Depending on where you live, the weather conditions may alter/affect the texture of your slime. Here are some helpful tips to remember with your slime!</p>
        <h3>SLIME CARE TIPS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Have activator ready before you play with your slime!</li>
            <li>Poke your slime first with 1 finger to check and see if it is too sticky, and needs activator.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands/playing surface before touching slime! Although slime has a limited shelf life, keeping your hands and table surfaces clean is important to helping keep your slime as long lasting as possible.</li>
            <li>Have fun with your slime!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>HOW TO MAKE &#38; USE ACTIVATOR:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 tsp borax (provided) to 1 cup of warm water.</li>
            <li>Mix solution until the borax dissolves.</li>
            <li>Add solution to slime in small amounts until slime reaches desired consistency.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>CARING FOR YOUR SLIME:</h4>
        <ol>
            <p>Slime has a limited life span. It is normal for slime to shrink and deflate over time!</p>
            <li>Wash your hands before touching your slime to reduce the dirt/dust caught in your slime.</li>
            <li>Always keep your slime an airtight container when you're not playing with it to prevent it from drying out!</li>
            <li>Reactivate it frequently! It's difficult to activate slime that has completely melted.</li>
            <li>Store out of the sun or in a cool place.</li>
        </ol>
        <b>What to do if your slime is...</b>
        <p><b>...hard?</b>  If it is cold where you live try warming the slime up using the heat from your hands. Gently knead the slime until it softens. If this does not work you can try adding small amounts of lotion/water to your slime. (Note: only add water to soften clear slime to preserve its clarity)</p>
        <p><b>...sticky?</b> Slowly add activator until your slime reaches the desired consistency! Knead any lumps out of your slime until it's smooth.</p>
        <p><b>...still sticky?</b> Not all slimes are meant to be holdable! Some slimes are meant to be slightly sticky and played with on surfaces.</p>
        <p><b>...beads falling out?</b> The beads will start fall out if you add too much activator. Leave your slime alone for some time and it will naturally melt over time, or you can add a bit of glue.</p>
        <h4>CLOUD SLIME TIPS:</h4>
        <b>What to do if your cloud slime is...</b>
        <p><b>...hard?</b> Try adding in small amounts lotion or glue to soften it!</p>
        <p><b>...crumbling?</b> Add activator in small amounts &#38; knead until smooth.</p>
        <p><b>...shedding/ leaving fallout?</b> Donâ€™t worry, it is normal for cloud slimes to have some slight fall out. You can simply use the bigger piece of slime to collect the fallout. However, if you do notice excessive amounts of fallout add small amounts of liquid to your slime.</p>
